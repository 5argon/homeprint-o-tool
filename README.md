![Uncut Sheet](documentation/image/uncut-sheet.jpg)

A desktop software that creates duplex [uncut sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncut_currency_sheet) image files out of individual graphics.

Uncut sheet is similar to a contact sheet, but they have cut guidelines along the edge, and the graphic has a [bleed area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleed_(printing)) extending outside its intended content area to account for duplex printing misalignment or cutting errors. You define the bleed area of each graphics inversely by their content area instead (specify the part you want).

Though you can use this program to lay out anything you like, such as photos that you don't need to care about the backside at all, it is originally designed to print card game graphics. From this point on I'll refer to each unit of printing as a card, and the front and back graphics of the card are "front face" and "back face" respectively.

It only creates `.png` files of the front side and backside of the uncut sheets. If you need them in other formats like `.pdf`, you must process them further in other programs on your own.

Not only for home printing, you can use the output to negotiate with non-specialized print shops around you to work on jobs that they are normally not willing to. Anything not as simple as business cards printing comes with complexity, tedium, and error-prone nature of layout work. Now you can do that part of the work at your own leisure and might even get discounts because they now only need to print and cut the work.
