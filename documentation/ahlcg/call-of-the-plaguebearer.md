# Call of the Plaguebearer Campaign

A fan-made campaign by Dr. Jack Science.

When I tried to download the project in the provided Google Drive link, it seems to not able to download the entire folder, but I could download just the `Campaign with Bleed` folder inside. If you had the same problem, downloading just `Campaign with Bleed` is fine since that is all the JSON project file will use. Create a new folder to put `Campaign with Bleed` inside, and place these files besides it.

There is no structure of folders inside `Campaign with Bleed`, just massive 764 graphic files. The grouping feature of this program can deal with this though, and I have roughly categorize them so they became easier to manage.
