# Special Walkthrough for Arkham Horror: The Card Game players

This was a program originally created for the need to get extra content of Arkham Horror: The Card Game (AHLCG) game (both official print-and-play content and fan-made) printed where I don't have to order popular services like [MPC](https://www.makeplayingcards.com) with steep transit and import prices.

Instead, I must use local print shops. They have excellent laser printer (still not exactly offset printer official one uses), yet don't know a thing about card games. They are not very willing to print anything besides bulk credit cards with solid colored backgrounds because of the extra work that comes with pairing the correct back face and messing with bleeds in card games.

With the output from this program, I can just tell them to print the PDF file I gave, and they get my money. I'll even cut them out on my own to save their time!

You should read the [regular walkthrough](../walkthrough.md) first. This special walkthrough expands on them with some pre-made project files that print some of the most desirable custom content for this game. You can learn tricks from these examples before you create your own project.
